# async-sink

The asynchronous `Sink` trait for the tokio ecosystem.

This is largely equivalent to the `Sink` trait seen in the [futures-util](https://docs.rs/futures-util) crate, but has been adapted to use equivalent IO and [streaming](https://docs.rs/async-sink) traits from the tokio ecosystem.
